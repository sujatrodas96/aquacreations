<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Stocking an aquarium is one of the most exciting parts of the fishkeeping hobby:an empty aquarium offers the hobbyist hundreds of choices of species of fish.Although most fish at aquatics retailers are suitable for the average home aquarium if the tank setup and water parameters are adequate, some species should be avoided at all costs.Beginners to the hobby, however, may not be aware of this and may purchase a fish that is entirely unsuitable for their aquarium.Recently,these “monster fish”have begun to appear at aquatic retailers more commonly, and are thus making their way into hobbyists’homes more frequently.This trend is problematic, as it generally results in the animal suffering, and sometimes ultimately being released into the wild, where it can contribute to the establishment of an invasive population which has the potential to wreak havoc on the local ecosystem.<br>
The following is a list of ten of these fish, and a smaller, more reasonably sized alternative for each.</p>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color:orange">1 – Redtail Catfish</h2>
<img src="rtc.jpg" height="200" width="300"><p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">The quintessential tank-buster, only the largest tanks in public aquariums can properly house a mature Redtail catfish. A fast-growing species, it can easily grow an inch per week when young and reach a length of 24″ / 60 cm in less than a year. Adult specimens frequently measure upwards of 48″ / 120 cm – the largest recorded Redtail catfish was 63″ / 160 cm in length and weighed 123 lb / 55 kg. They are frustratingly common in aquatic retailers, usually sold as small, endearing juveniles: it is only a few months later, once the animal has already begun to grow into a monster, that the hobbyist begins to realize how unsuitable the species is for their aquarium.</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Tank-friendly alternative: Almost any catfish available for sale at an aquatic retailer would be a better choice than a Redtail catfish. Raphael catfish (Platydoras spp.) are somewhat similar in both appearance and personality, and are much more suitable for home aquariums. Corydoras catfish are good choices as well, being suitable for all but the smallest aquariums.</p>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color:orange">2 – Tiger Shovelnose Catfish</h2>
<img src="tsc.jpg" height="200" width="300"><p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">The second fish on our list that has no place in home aquariums of any kind, the Tiger shovelnose regularly reaches 48″ / 120 cm in length in captivity and is reported to measure up to 8’ / 2.5 m in the wild. Enormous aquariums containing thousands of gallons of water are required to house this species, and even these would not allow the animal to move around as it normally would in the wild. They are somewhat challenging to feed: not because they are picky eaters, but rather due to the enormous amount of food they need to sustain their rapid growth rate and metabolism.</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Tank-friendly alternative: There are few catfish that would be a worse choice for an aquarium than the Tiger shovelnose. The Pictus catfish (Pimelodus pictus) is somewhat similar in appearance to the Tiger shovelnose catfish, but only reaches lengths of 5″ / 12 cm. Most Synodontis catfish are also good choices.</p>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color:orange">3 – Arowana</h2>
<img src="arw.jpg" height="200" width="300">
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Commonly known as the dragonfish, Arowana are as majestic and as incredible to observe as they are unsuitable for most home aquariums. Despite many species being frequently available for sale at aquatic retailers, Arowana reach lengths of 36” / 90 cm to 48” / 120 cm depending on the species and thus require enormous aquariums. A powerful fish, Arowana are adept jumpers: in captivity, this can be problematic, as a stressed specimen or one kept in too small of an aquarium will repeatedly jump and ultimately injure itself.</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Tank-friendly alternative: Even the smallest Arowana grows to 3’ / 1 m in length and is thus not recommended for beginners. The African butterflyfish (Pantodon buchholzi) is a fascinating surface-dwelling species that’s as unique in appearance as the Arowana, and although still somewhat demanding, is a much better choice for most hobbyists.</p>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color:orange">4 - Pacu</h2>
<img src="pacu.jpg" height="200" width="300">
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Although most gouramis are wonderful choices for beginners, the giant gourami – as the name suggests – is not. An active fish with a high metabolism, the giant gourami can grow to more than 24″ / 60 cm in length, and does so quite rapidly. An aquarium of at least 200 gallons / 750 litres is generally recommended for a single specimen; if kept in smaller tanks, giant gouramis can become quite aggressive towards tankmates.</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Tank-friendly alternative: Most other gouramis are good choices for smaller, peaceful community aquariums. The pearl gourami (Trichopodus leerii) is a particularly good choice, as it is attractive, peaceful, and reasonably sized.</p>
<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;color:orange">5 – Oscar</h2>
<img src="oscar.jpg" height="200" width="300">
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Growing rapidly to approximately 12″/ 30 cm in length, the Oscar is not quite as large as the other species on this list, but is a worthy inclusion nonetheless due to its popularity. Curious, full of personality, and relatively undemanding, the Oscar is a great fish for beginners and experienced hobbyists alike, but requires a large aquarium and powerful filtration. Generally sold at sizes of approximately 2″ / 5 cm, juvenile Oscars are both adorable and inquisitive. Once purchased, however, they will eat absolutely everything in sight and will rapidly need an aquarium of at least 100 gallons / 375 litres.</p>
<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">Tank-friendly alternative: Despite not growing to be unreasonably large, the Oscar is still not a great choice for the average hobbyist. Slightly smaller South American cichlids, such as the Chocolate cichlid (Hypselecara temporalis) and the Firemouth cichlid (Thorichthys meeki), may be a better option.</p>
